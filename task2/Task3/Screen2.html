        <h1>RED CARD 2018</h1>
        <h2>China Digital Football Awards </h2>

        <p class="headerText">
            The Red Card is globally recognised as the leading annual report to assesses the most influential European football clubs, leagues and players online in China. Now in its 7th year, Red Card 2018 has been reimagined to include 5 additional awards to recognise the many areas of digital performance in China, thereby taking the Red Card report to a whole new level. Due to the nature and variety of these new categories, the winners will be chosen by a panel of 6 industry experts, rather than by the traditional metrics used to assess the three headline awards.
        </p>

        <p class="headerText2">This report aims to educate teams and organisations on how to improve their China digital strategy, what today’s Chinese fan wants and what works online in China.
